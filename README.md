Make a list of bros and not bros via a Express App that does create, read, update and delete using a JSON file. 

This app is an intro into mongoDB. 

We use handlebars for the view engine.
	npm package: express-handlebars
		https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars

We'll use forms to create, edit and delete - but to do so - we'll use method-override to be able to make put and delete requests.
	npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override

To be able to store and retrieve data from a json file, we'll use the flatfile package. 
	npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatfile
